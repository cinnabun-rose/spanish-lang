Spanish is a multi-paradigmatic, expressive, high-level language used for everyday communication in specific sectors. Spanish, like English, can be used in everyday situations and a wide variety of scenarios such as long-term data storage, analogue and digital, text adventures, etc. 

Spanish has been designed over the course of fourteen centuries. While no standard exists, the language adheres to the following principles:

- Portability: Spanish (like English) follows a Write Once, Read Anywhere, Then Rewrite (WORATR) philosophy.
- Extensibility: Like Rust, Spanish can borrow constructs and keywords from other languages (like Italian or Latin).
- Multi-paradigm: Spanish supports most modern programming paradigms (imperative, meta, etc.)
- Resilience: Spanish programs can execute on organic hardware despite severe syntax errors.
- Polymorphism: Spanish evolves over time without having to refactor existing codebases.

Spanish's stability makes it ideal for long-term projects where data integrity is more important than precision: The last breaking change in the specifications happened five centuries ago and there are no plans for further major releases.

Spanish's mantra is "there's more than one way to say it".
 
## Syntax

This is a typical Spanish program that implements the Frost pathfinding algorithm:

```
Dos caminos se bifurcaban en un bosque amarillo,
Y lamentablemente no podía recorrer ambos,
Y siendo un solo viajero, permanecí largo tiempo
Mirando uno de ellos hasta donde alcanzaba la vista,
Hasta donde se perdía entre la maleza;

Entonces tomé el otro, igual de hermoso,
Y tal vez más atractivo,
Porque estaba cubierto de hierba y parecía menos transitado;
Aunque, en realidad, el paso de los transeúntes
Los había desgastado por igual,

Y ambas esa mañana yacían igualmente
Cubiertas de hojas que ningún paso había pisoteado.
¡Oh, dejé la primera para otro día!
Sin embargo, sabiendo cómo un camino lleva a otro,
Dudé si alguna vez volvería.

Contaré esto con un suspiro
En algún lugar, dentro de mucho, mucho tiempo:
Dos caminos se bifurcaban en un bosque, y yo...
Tomé el menos transitado,
Y eso marcó toda la diferencia.
```

Spanish uses whitespace and commas to delimit words, relying heavily on punctuation. Statements can end with a period or, less frequently, with a semicolon. Blocks are usually separated by two or more line breaks. Correct statements are always written in sentence case.

### Operators

English uses the following operators:

- `¡ and !`: Emphasize execution (similar to CSS's `!important`). Can be stacked - Use ¡ to start the emphasis.
- `¿ and ?`: Request information or open data stream thread. Can be stacked - Use ¿ to start the request.
- `,`: Concatenate statements in the same block  
- `.`: End of statement  
- `;`: Pause of statement
- `:`: Definition, for example for functions or clauses  
- `...`: Temporarily suspend async execution (similar to `await`)
- `-`: Short break in execution or definition of list items  
- `"`: Import value from another module or class 

Code comments are added using parentheses or round brackets. Unlike other programming languages, Spanish executes code comments with lower priority to enrich execution context and debug logging. For example:

```
(No sé qué estoy haciendo.)
```

Spanish operators can be overloaded, although this is not recommended by the Royal Spanish Academia (RAE) committee.

### Statements and control flow

Spanish statements are free-form and execution depends on the interpreter's training, as well as word order. Conditional execution and exception handling also depend on the mood and tense of the keywords, as well as resources available.

### Keywords

Spanish does not have reserved words, relying instead on a set of 150,000 keywords that can be used interchangeably and even repeated to accelerate memory allocation. The training process results in scores that make the usage of certain keywords less likely. Keywords that score higher in the profanity dimension might cause the system to panic.

## Data structures

Spanish only has two data structures, Lists and Raw. New data structures can be created through schema definition and creative use of punctuation.

## Typing

Spanish uses context-sensitive and duck typing. The only base types are `strings` and `numbers`, with no size limit. Buffer overflows are typically handled by the interpreter, which performs just-in-time (JIT) type casting and guessing. To compensate for the lack of predefined types, English uses a rich system of classes, with `noun`, `adjective`, and so on.

## Documentation

Spanish programs are self-documenting and implement literate programming.

## Tooling

Currently, the only compiler available is Wérnica. It requires a temporal lobe trained in social settings for at least three to four years, though better results can be achieved with training runs in excess of 30 years.

Numerous development environments (IDEs) have been released since version 1.0. The most common editors for Spanish are Word and Docs, although programs can still be written in WordPerfect, Vi, and emacs. Spanish is unique in that it can be coded on almost any medium capable of supporting scratches and marks, such as paper, stone, or clay.

There are millions of Spanish libraries available. You can look for the closest in Google Maps.

## Community

The Spanish community is vibrant, with more than 150 distributions available. For a complete list of forks see [List of dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dialects_and_varieties).
